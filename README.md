# Arc-resistance-
test


Arc resistance  D495

There are some limits for the products we make on molding machines. When they are in contact with electricity, they should resist the electricity load. When we put the product in arc resistance, after some time, the product fails. Lastly, the reading should be checked for different products. There are international and national standards for this test.
